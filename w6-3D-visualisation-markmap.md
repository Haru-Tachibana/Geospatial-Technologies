# Visualisation

## 6.1 Visualising Geographic Info
### Mayson's Ordnance Model
### recreation of Victorian times physical models
- also integrate computer techniques to reconstruct Mayson model
- interaction with tourists, model, animation on the wall etc.
### GIS-based visualisation
- often 2D or 2.5D
### Categrories of map design
- Purpose
- Audience
- Content
- Context
- Design 

### from maps to geo-visualisation
- multi-dimentional, far beyond map
- shift from communication to exploration
### geo-visualisation
- Interactive maps - can include live-data feeds, story map, dashboard
- Data visualisation - multiple views, 
- 3D visualisation - Google Earth, natural frame of reference, visualise volume (e.g., Carbon Visuals)

### UX - user experience
#### HCI - human computer interaction
#### UX
- more industiral focussed version of HCI
- understand how ppl use 3D viusalisations


## 6.2 Animation

### keyframes
- a tradition of 2D animation
- works in 3D by unterpolating shape, texture, size, position of objects (incl. camera)

#### changing perspective
#### Google Earth 
#### case study - commercial use

## 6.3 Landscape Visualisation

### purposes
- demostrate impact on landscape
- show change over time
- place sth into spatial context
- 'eye candy' i.e., visual apealing
- serve as a common language, support discussion and decision-making
